            <p>
              We appreciate that you have provided your information to us and may not want us to share it with other people or organisations, however sometimes it is necessary for us to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              We only share your information where we are permitted or required to by law, or where you have requested us to do so. We may share your information with, for example:

            </ul>
            <p>We are careful to minimise such sharing.</p>
            <p>
              Although we are a UK company, we may sometimes share your information with an organisation who is outside the UK. Such companies may also be outside of Europe. We may do this, but we will only do so where we are permitted to by law.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              We think it likely that our customers know we use information about them, and we provide notices of such wherever we can.
            </p>
            <p>
              We never use information about you unless it is lawful for us to do so and we have a clearly defined need or purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we collect information about you we ensure that we minimise what we collect. We try not to keep your information for longer than we need it and we ensure that the records we have about you are managed properly and deleted promptly and securely when we no longer need them.

            <p>
              We make every effort to ensure your rights towards your information, which we detail below.

            <p>
              We take appropriate care to secure the information we hold about you. We have robust technical security such as passwords and information encryption. We also have policies and procedures to ensure your information is only available to our employees who need to see it to do their job, and we train those employees appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, we establish robust procedures and contracts to extend these protections to any other person or organisation we may need to give your information to.
